# UltimateShopRewrite
Simple rewrite of the free version of [UltimateShops](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/ultimateshops-player-admin-item-shops-1-8-1-15-x-lite.61048/) that incorporates a change rate function for the customer GUI. This allows customers to decide if they would like to purchase a multiplication of the amount of items presented by the seller. Advantages are less spam in chat (for buyer and seller) and less transaction handling.

## Requirements:

- This plugin requires **[Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault)** to be installed.
- This plugin requires a "Vault Economy Provider" plugin to be installed. Some examples: **[Essentials](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)**, **[AConomy](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/aconomy-simple-vault-economy.64569/)**.

## How to use:

- Create an executable .jar file from the code in this repository
- Put the .jar in the plugins folder of your 1.13.2 server from, for example, [craftbukkit](https://getbukkit.org/download/craftbukkit)
- By modifying the config files in the  "UltimateShops" folder generated by the jar, you can change how the  plugin performs to your liking. You must restart your server or use  "/ushops reload" to apply changes.
